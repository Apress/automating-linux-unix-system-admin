## User Aliases
## These aren't often necessary, as you can use regular groups
## (ie, from files, LDAP, NIS, etc) in this file - just use %groupname
## rather than USERALIAS

User_Alias ADMINS = nate, kirk

## Command Aliases
## These are groups of related commands...
## Networking

Cmnd_Alias NETWORKING = /sbin/route, /sbin/ifconfig, /bin/ping, /sbin/dhclient, /usr/bin/net, /sbin/iptables, /usr/bin/rfcomm, /usr/bin/wvdial, /sbin/iwconfig, /sbin/mii-tool

## Installation and management of software
Cmnd_Alias SOFTWARE = /bin/rpm, /usr/bin/up2date, /usr/bin/yum

## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:

##
## user MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking

%sys ALL = NETWORKING

## Allows the ADMINS user alias to run software commands
ADMINS ALL = SOFTWARE
