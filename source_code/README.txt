Thank you for your interest in Automating UNIX and Linux Administration, 2nd
ed.  This book was published in December 2008 by Apress and written by Nate
Campi and Kirk Bauer.  You can submit corrections on the Apress website
(www.apress.com).  You can also contact the authors directly at:
nate@campin.net (www.campin.net)

You will need to change the first line of the few Perl scripts included if the
location of the Perl binary in your environment differs from /usr/bin/perl.

All files are in the UNIX file format.  If you are viewing these in Windows,
you must either convert them, use an editor like TextPad (www.textpad.com) or
Vim (www.vim.org), or install the Cygwin suite of programs.

Note that program and configuration file listings consisting of 10 lines or
less are generally not included.  

Be sure to look inside any subdirectories in each chapter folder, the
organization of cfengine configuration files is preserved here, so if you don't
look inside the "inputs" directories, you'll miss all the cfengine files.
