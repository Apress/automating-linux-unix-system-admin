        # have no entries, but under solaris there's always a root crontab and if you
        # say autocreate - cfengine won't ever edit the file, I have no idea why. The docs
        # say "If this command is listed anywhere in the file action list, cfengine will 
        # create the named file if it doesn't exist" but on solaris/sparc with cfengine 2.1.18
        # it simply prevents the crontab from being edited AT ALL.
